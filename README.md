## What?

A simple 'webpage' generator, just as an example for a nephew of me to try to encourage him to get into programming.
As you enter the page, you can fill out the form. Based on the information, you get a personal webpage.
As a beginner in HTML/CSS/JavaScript it was my aim to get it working in the first place. There is still room for optimalisation, but for progress I ended this project.
